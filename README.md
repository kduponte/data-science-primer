# Galvanize Data Science Primer

This is a collection of self paced resources for anyone looking to get into data science. The materials assume an absolute beginner and are intended to prepare students for the Galvanize Data Science interview process: http://www.galvanize.com/courses/data-science/ 

## Getting Started

We see many aspiring data scientist come to us from a variety of backgrounds: statisticians, mechanical engineers, political scientists, business analysts, software engineers, etc., etc. We have pretty much seen it all!  And many of these folks come to us with one simple question:

> Where do I get started?

This respository is a curated set of the best resources out there to provide an on-ramp to becoming a data scientist no matter someone's background.  The skills needed can be broken up into the following topics: Programming (Python for us!), Linear Algebra, Statistics, Probability, and SQL.  And as extra, it helps to have a high level overview of machine learning.

By no means do you need to be an expert in all of these, but we have identified these topics as the ones that we have seen set students up for success.  And as such, anyone who is looking to apply to our [Galvanize Data Science Immersive](http://www.galvanize.com/courses/data-science/ ) program can prepare for the interview/application process by completing these resources!
